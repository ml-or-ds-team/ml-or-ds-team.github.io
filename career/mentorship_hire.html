<p><h4>Thank you for your interest in joining us for the mentorship program.</h4></p>

<p> We want to speak with you for 15 minutes, where we can understand each other a little bit better. 
 <br> If everything looks good,
    we would love to have you meet one of the core members from the team for 30-45 minutes. We are extremely humble 
  and we want to ensure a good quaility of mentorship as long as 
  we make the commitment to you. Therefore, we implement the chat session as an interview to understand your interest, 
  and to make sure we are the right choice for you. 
  <br>
  During the 30-45 minutes chat, we will want to
  <ul>
    <li> understand your interest and goal</li>
    <li> ask you questions on domain knowledge and case study</li>
    <li> (sometimes...) have you work out a very lightweighted coding exercise in Python</li>
</ul> 
<br/>
We want to make sure you feel comfortable in the chat session, and we are very flexible in the process. 
We will communicate with you and discuss the process prior to the chat! 
  </p>
