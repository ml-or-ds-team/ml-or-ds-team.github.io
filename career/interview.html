<p><h4>Thank you for your interest in joining the team.</h4></p>

<p>We put an interview process together so to understand your expertise, experience and interest beyond your AWESOME Resume.
    We also want you to have opportunity and plenty of time to ask us questions.<br/> 
    <br/>
    Before the interview, we want to have a quick chat with you to introduce the team and understand your interest. If we have mutual interest,
    we would love to invite you to the interview process. <br>
    <br/>
    The interview process will be of THREE rounds.
    <ul>
        <li> Intro + Experience Chat: 30 minutes</li>
        <li> Case Study + Domain Knowledge: 30 minutes</li>
        <li> Coding + Design: 30-45 minutes</li>
    </ul>
    While we explicitly list time constraint for each round, we want to make sure you have enough time to chat with us, 
    solve a problem, finish your coding task, and ASK US TONS OF QUESTIONS. Therefore, we are very flexible in time constraints,
    and we want you to feel comfortable as much as possible!<br/>
    <br/>
    Just a tip, we are a fast-paced team, we take risks, and we care about business results more than anything else ... 
    we expect you can help us maintain this culture, and we belive you can!!!<br/>
</p>
